## Objectives

The objective of this project was to analyze:

- satellite imagery and monitor changes in the Winam Gulf and its littoral area between 1984-2022,
- to build the Hyatrak predictor, a model that can forecast the distribution and growth of water hyacinth.

<br>

The model will assist in preventing negative impacts caused by water hyacinth and support the sustainable use of the invasive plant in the production of biofuels and biorenewables.
<br>

## Notes

This project was conducted by (AET) Aquaethanol Technologies.

AET will test the Hyatrak predictor as a pilot project, and if successful, optimize and upscale the use of the model to other regions experiencing ecological challenges caused by water hyacinth encroachment globally.

## Support

This project was supported by the International Sustainability Academy (ISA), Hamburg, Germany.
